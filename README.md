# Reading

I believe it is of vital importance to read to keep upto date with the latest technologies and the advancements that are being made to existing technologies. To keep up-to date with what is going on I read a number of blog posts. To deep dive into a topic I tend to lean more towards books as this often gives a broader coverage of the area and also allows the author to go as deep as they need with the subject matter when they feel it is required.

Below is a list of the sources I find useful and hopefully people who come across the is resource will find them equally as useful.
